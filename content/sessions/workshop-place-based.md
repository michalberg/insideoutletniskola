How does the place where we learn shape what and how we learn?
This outdoor workshop explores place-based education as a framework
for connecting learners to their local environment, community,
and culture.

Participants will experience place-based methods first-hand — leaving
the building to engage with the landscape of Předklášteří — and then
reflect on how these approaches can be adapted for their own contexts,
whether in urban schools, nature settings, or community organisations.

We will also examine the theory: what does the research say about
why learning "in place" can be so powerful, and what are its limits?
