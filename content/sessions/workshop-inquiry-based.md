An experiential workshop in which participants design and prototype
inquiry-based learning sequences for their own contexts.

We will use a simple design framework to move from identifying a
genuine question to building a learning arc that follows the question.
Participants will work in small groups and share their designs for
peer feedback.

**Bring:** A learning challenge or question from your own practice
that you would like to work on.

**Suitable for:** Teachers, curriculum designers, school leaders.
