This session presents research on alternative assessment practices
and opens a dialogue about what it would mean to assess *for* learning
rather than *of* learning.

Drawing on case studies from schools experimenting with narrative reports,
portfolios, and learning conferences, we will examine the conditions
under which assessment can become a conversation rather than a verdict.

Participants are invited to bring examples from their own contexts
for discussion.
