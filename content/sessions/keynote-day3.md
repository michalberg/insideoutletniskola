What makes a school a genuine learning community — a place where
not just students, but teachers, leaders, and parents are all
engaged in continuous growth and inquiry?

This keynote explores the conditions under which schools themselves
become learning organisations. Drawing on Peter Senge's work,
as well as examples from schools across Central Europe, we examine
what leadership, culture, and structure need to look like for a school
to truly learn from its own experience.

The talk will challenge participants to think about their own institution:
what is one thing that could shift to make it more of a learning community?
