What is the difference between discussion and dialogue? And why does
it matter for learning?

This workshop explores the theory and practice of genuine classroom
dialogue — conversations in which participants are truly open to
changing their minds, and in which meaning is created together rather
than transmitted from one party to another.

Drawing on the work of David Bohm, Paulo Freire, and more recent
research in dialogic teaching, we will practise specific facilitation
moves that open up dialogue rather than closing it down.

Participants will leave with a repertoire of concrete techniques —
and a deeper understanding of why changing the quality of talk
in a classroom can change everything else.
