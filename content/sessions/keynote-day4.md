Why do so many students do exactly what they are told — and nothing more?
And why do others become deeply, intrinsically motivated learners who
seek out challenges and persist in the face of difficulty?

This keynote draws on self-determination theory, motivational research,
and the lived experience of teachers to explore what it really means
to support student agency. We will challenge some common assumptions
about motivation — including the idea that rewards and pressure are
effective tools for learning — and offer a more human-centred alternative.

The talk will be followed by a structured discussion in small groups,
feeding into the afternoon's workshop sessions.
