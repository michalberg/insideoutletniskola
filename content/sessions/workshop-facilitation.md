What does it mean to facilitate rather than teach? This workshop
explores facilitation as a pedagogical orientation — a set of
dispositions, skills, and tools that shift the locus of learning
from the teacher to the group.

Through practice and reflection, participants will experience and
debrief facilitation techniques that can be adapted for classroom,
staff meeting, and community contexts.

**No prior facilitation experience required.**
