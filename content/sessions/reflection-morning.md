Each morning of Inside Out Pedagogies begins with a short communal
reflection practice. On the final morning, we extend this into
a deeper Practice Circle — a structured space for participants
to share what has shifted for them during the week.

What has surprised you? What are you taking home? What question
are you leaving with that you didn't arrive with?

Practice Circles are small-group conversations facilitated
by participants themselves, using a simple Quaker-inspired format
that values silence, listening, and honest speaking.
