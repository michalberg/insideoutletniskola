What does a truly democratic school look like? What would it take to
create spaces where learners genuinely participate in decisions about
their learning, their community, and their shared life?

This keynote draws on the experience of democratic schools in Poland
and internationally to explore what democratic education means in practice
— and what we can learn from it even if we work in more conventional
institutional settings.
