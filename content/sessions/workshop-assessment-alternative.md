Grades are the most visible artefact of a system that reduces learning
to measurement. But what are the alternatives, and can they actually work
in real schools and institutions?

In this hands-on workshop, we will explore a range of alternative
and authentic assessment approaches: portfolios, self-assessment,
peer feedback, learning journals, and competency-based approaches.

Participants will have the opportunity to try out tools, discuss
their applicability in different contexts, and begin designing
a small assessment experiment they can take back to their own work.

No prior knowledge of assessment theory is required — just an open
mind and a willingness to question the familiar.
