We open the conference with a community-building session that sets the tone
for three days of inquiry, dialogue, and co-creation. Participants will have
the opportunity to meet each other, share their intentions for the conference,
and co-create the community agreements that will guide our time together.

Come ready to be present, curious, and open.
