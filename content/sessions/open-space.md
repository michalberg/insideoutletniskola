Open Space Technology creates a self-organising conference within a conference.
Participants propose topics, claim a space and a time, and whoever comes
is the right people. The law of two feet applies: move on when you are
no longer learning or contributing.

Topics typically emerging in Open Space at Inside Out Pedagogies include:
peer learning, alternative schooling models, working with reluctant learners,
teacher wellbeing, community education, and much more.

*This session cannot be pre-described — it will be created by you.*
