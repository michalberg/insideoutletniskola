We close the conference by harvesting what we have learned — individually
and collectively. Participants will have space to reflect on their key
insights, intentions for their practice, and connections made.

We will also look ahead: what is the Inside Out Pedagogies community
doing next? How can we stay connected and support each other's work
across the year?

*See you next year.*
