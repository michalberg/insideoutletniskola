Design thinking is not just for product designers. Its core mindset —
empathy, iteration, prototyping, and testing — is deeply relevant
for anyone who designs learning experiences.

In this practical workshop, participants will work through a compressed
design thinking cycle applied to a real educational challenge.
Starting with empathy interviews, moving through ideation to rapid
prototyping, and ending with peer feedback, this session gives
you a lived experience of the process.

By the end, you will have both a prototype of a new learning activity
and a transferable framework you can use to approach any educational
design problem.
