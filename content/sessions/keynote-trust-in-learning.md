What happens to learning when trust is absent? And what becomes possible
when it is fully present? This opening keynote explores trust as the
foundational condition for genuine education — drawing on research,
practice, and personal experience.

We will examine what it means to trust learners, how teachers can build
trustworthy environments, and what the systemic obstacles to trust are
in contemporary schooling. The keynote will set up themes that we will
return to throughout the three days.
