## We Believe Education Can Be Different

We, the Inside Out Pedagogies community, believe that meaningful education
begins with trust — trust in learners, trust in educators, and trust in
the process of genuine inquiry.

## Our Principles

### 1. Learning Is Relational

Education is not a transaction between a knowledge-holder and an empty vessel.
It is a relationship built on curiosity, care, and mutual respect.
The quality of the relationship shapes the quality of learning.

### 2. Curriculum Follows the Learner

We reject the idea that a fixed curriculum must precede the learner's
needs and questions. We start with the person — their experiences,
their puzzles, their passions — and build from there.

### 3. Teachers Are Learners Too

No one holds the final answer. Teachers and students learn together,
question together, and are surprised together. Hierarchy of knowing
yields to a community of inquiry.

### 4. Slow Is Fast

Deep learning takes time. We resist the pressure to cover, perform,
and produce at the cost of genuine understanding. We create space
for thinking to unfold, for ideas to be tried and revised.

### 5. Context Matters

Education never happens in a vacuum. Who we are, where we come from,
what power structures we inhabit — all of this shapes what and how
we learn. We name these forces and work with them consciously.

### 6. Joy Is Not Optional

Learning that lasts is learning that is joyful — even when the subject
is difficult, even when the questions are uncomfortable. We protect
and cultivate the pleasure of discovery.

### 7. Community Over Competition

We learn more, and better, together than alone. We build communities
of practice where people take risks, share failures, and celebrate
each other's growth.

## An Invitation

This manifesto is not a finished document. It is an ongoing conversation.
We invite you to bring your own principles, your own doubts, and your own
experience to the table. Together, we continue writing it.
